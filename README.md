# countseq

This is a small but useful R package, built using de facto standard genomic Bioconductor packages like Biostrings [1] and GenomicRanges [2], that allows the user to count occurrences of multiple patterns in multiple text strings.
The package is fully tested and documented. It is also conformed to Bioconductor best practices, thanks to several run using BiocCheck [3].
